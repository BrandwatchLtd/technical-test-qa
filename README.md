# ðŸš€ Technical Test ðŸš€
The purpose of this test is 3 fold:
* To see what test scenarios you come up with
* How well you understand technical documentations
* How comfortable are you with writing automation tests and what's your approach towards it. 

## ðŸ“• What you need to do:
* Sign up at https://gender-api.com/
* Read the api docs: https://gender-api.com/en/api-docs
* Think about how you want test the end points via automation tests

**NOTE**: You are free to use any language you are comfortable with, but for reference, we've provided a maven project using Jackson and RestAssured libraries that you can use (feel free to make any changes that you see fit)

## ðŸ§  Using the example test framework
The code is built with Java 8 (but if there's features you like in later versions, then you could ugprade this!) and can be built and run using Maven.
* `RestClient.java` simplifies the way you make a REST call using RestAssured library, just create an instance of RestClient and call utility methods such as `get` `post` to make call to an endpoint
* You can write test in either junit4 or junit5, junit5 example is in `PostsTests.java`.

## ðŸ“« Submitting the code
We take pride in keeping our Git history organised and easy to follow for the benefit of our code reviewers, so please organise your commits to reflect this.
Once complete, zip up your directory (including any .git files!) and sent it to the recruiter you've been in contact with, including a summary of what you have done.
 
## âœ… How will my work be evaluated?
Rome wasn't built in a day, and we are fair in our review given the time constraints. But some of the things we are looking for:
* Is the code clean, well organised and reusable
* Your understanding of the problem
* Scenarios Covered
* Coding Style
* Readability

Should you proceed to the next stage of the process, we often discuss the approach taken and what you may have done when given more time. 
Good luck!
